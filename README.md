project-1
=========

The first project has been about learning the first steps in web design without a crutch like DreamWeaver. This has been an eye opening experience. Reading about things like responsive vs. adaptive design and other leading edge current topics has set this class apart and made it extremely valuable to me. The content of the first project is also well chosen. The case could be made that everyone who is serious about technical communication should maintain a personal web presence that is current and reflective. 

I have been involved in creating sites with tools for many years. This is the first time I have started by opening a text editor. I have found the resources and the examples very helpful. I also really enjoyed the online course that was conducted via campfire. I was able to ask questions without feeling like I would slow everyone down. Additionally I could refer to the discussion chain later when I was working on my project.

I approached this task from many different angles. I started a new repository with the latest files however I am going to turn in a link with my original messy repository as well.  Using Github has been exceptional helpful for me because I have started over so many times and having the history to look at was great. 

I am looking forward to refining this project and adding the grid, the type-kit and I would like to make the size of my font change when the display size changes so I know I need to convert all the px setting to em.

Thanks,
April
